"""
In this Bite you get some more practice with datetime's useful
strptime and stftime.

Complete the two functions: years_ago and convert_eu_to_us_date
following the instructions in their docstrings.

This is the defintion and difference between the two:

- strptime: parse (convert) string to datetime object.
- strftime: create formatted string for given time/date/datetime object
according to specified format.

Reference: 8.1.8. strftime() and strptime() Behavior.
Link: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior
Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!
